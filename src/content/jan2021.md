Ready for 2021? I'm writing this post a couple of days before my 48th birthday. After what feels like years of reflection at my house with my family, no more travel, just all focus time :). I hope you like the new web page which uses Gatsby.js. I got inspired by  https://developer.newrelic.com, which also users Gatsby. Previously I was working with Go Hugo, which is very powerful, but new year, new tech, time to try something different.

I also enabled continuous deployments from GIT using GIT actions. Super cool, but I may forget how to log into the AWS console.

I highly recommend this very easy to follow blog post: https://blog.elantha.com/gatsby-github-actions/.

The last thing I know, all my pictures are of skiing. What else are you going to do when you can't leave the house? Go skiing every week, of course!
